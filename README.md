# CA FOOD BANK FINDER

As a student participating in AP with WE, I am undertaking the challenge of creating an app to address food resource scarcity. In many regions, including California, individuals and families struggle to access an adequate supply of nutritious food. By developing a tool that facilitates easy access to information about local food resources, such as food banks, I aim to contribute to alleviating this problem.

My objective is to create a website called "CA Food Bank Finder" aimed at offering comprehensive information regarding local food resources throughout California. Upon entering their city name, users will receive detailed insights into nearby food banks. This information will encompass essential details such as the food bank's name, location, contact details, web link, and more.

In addition, I hope that by making the code available as an open-source project, it will inspire additional efforts beyond my own to foster collaboration and innovation in the realm of food scarcity. This enables the instrument to be continuously enhanced and adapted in order to more effectively address the changing requirements of communities grappling with food insecurity. The ultimate objective is to develop a resource that provides the means for communities and individuals to effectively confront challenges related to food resources.
