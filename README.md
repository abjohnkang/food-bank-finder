# FOODBANK

As a student participating in AP with WE, I am undertaking the challenge of creating an app to address food resource scarcity.

My objective is to create a website aimed at offering comprehensive information regarding local food resources throughout California. Upon entering their city name, users will receive detailed insights into nearby food banks. This information will encompass essential details such as the food bank's name, location, contact details, web link, and more.

My code is based on Apache License 2.0. It allows you to use, modify, and distribute the licensed software, including creating derivative works, without requiring those derivative works to be licensed under the same terms. You can release the modified parts of the code under any license you prefer.
