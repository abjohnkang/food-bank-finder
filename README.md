# Foodbank

My goal is developing an app that provides information about local food resources in California. When users enter the name of the city where they are living, it will provide information about food banks in that city. Information could be the food bank's address, contact information, operating hours, eligibility criteria, etc.

# Dataset Source

The Dataset I used is from controllerdata.lacity.org, contain 1852 foodbanks' name, street adress, city, state, zip code, county, phone number, etc.
