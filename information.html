                  <hr>
                  <p class="content">A food bank is a non-profit organization or facility that collects, stores, and distributes food to those who are in need, typically with the assistance of volunteers.
                    They play a crucial role in addressing food insecurity by providing assistance to individuals and families who may struggle to afford or access an adequate amount of nutritious food.

                <hr>
                <p class="content">Regarding eligibility for receiving assistance from a food bank, it can vary depending on the policies of the specific food bank or the programs they offer.
                  However, in general, eligibility is based on financial need and individuals or families must demonstrate that they are unable to afford an adequate amount of food on their own.
                  Proof of income, residency, or other documentation may be required to receive assistance. Additionally, some food banks may have specific eligibility criteria based on factors such as household size, age, disability, or other circumstances.
                  It's best to contact your local food bank or visit their website to learn more about their eligibility requirements and the assistance programs they offer.
